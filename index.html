      <p id="about">The trombone is a musical instrument in the brass family. As with all brass
         instruments, sound is produced when the player's vibrating lips (embouchure) cause 
         the air column inside the instrument to vibrate. Unlike most other brass instruments, 
         which have valves that, when pressed, alter the pitch of the instrument, trombones 
         instead have a telescoping slide mechanism that varies the length of the instrument to 
         change the pitch. However, many modern trombone models also have a valve attachment 
         which lowers the pitch of the instrument. Variants such as the valve trombone and 
         superbone have three valves similar to those on the trumpet.

      <p id="Construction">The trombone is a predominantly cylindrical tube bent into an elongated "S" shape. 
         Rather than being completely cylindrical from end to end, the tube is a complex 
         series of tapers with the smallest at the mouthpiece receiver and the largest just
         before the bell flare. The design of these tapers affects the intonation of the
         instrument. As with other brass instruments, sound is produced by blowing air
         through pursed lips producing a vibration that creates a standing wave in the 
         instrument.

      <p id="Contemporary use">The trombone can be found in symphony orchestras, concert bands, marching bands, 
         military bands, brass bands, and brass choirs. In chamber music, it is used in brass
         quintets, quartets, or trios, or trombone trios, quartets, or choirs. The size of a
         trombone choir can vary from five or six to twenty or more members. Trombones are 
         also common in swing, jazz, merengue, salsa, R&B, ska, and New Orleans brass bands.
